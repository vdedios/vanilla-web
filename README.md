## What's all this?

  <p>This site is meant to be a list of exercises to improve your web development skills.</p>

## Instructions
<div>
  <p> The idea is simple, surf through all different website sections, pick an example/concept you want to master and start replicating it. If you encounter problems doing so just use your built in explorer developer tools!</p>
  <p>And always remember, learn by doing not by looking</p>
